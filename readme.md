# Blocks
There are many partial minecraft clones out there. It's time to make a complete one.
I'm targetting a kind of mix between classic, alpha and beta. I don't want a nether, slabs/stairs, beds or dungeons. But I do want colored wool. And bricks. Lol. And seasons.

### Build:
- Have CMake installed
```bash
git clone https://github.com/recidivism5/Blocks.git
cd Blocks
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make //If using gnu tools. Otherwise open the generated solution in Visual Studio.
```

- [ ] Chunks stored in 2d MCRegion style files (maybe make it compatible with minecraft world files)
