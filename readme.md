# Blocks
There are many partial minecraft clones out there. It's time to make a complete one.
I'm targetting a kind of mix between classic, alpha and beta. I don't want a nether, slabs/stairs or beds. But I do want colored wool.
### Necessary features:
- [ ] 2d chunks stored in MCRegion style files (maybe make it compatible with minecraft world files)
- [ ] Procedural generation
- [ ] Voxel global illumination (same type used in minecraft)
- [ ] Full clone of crafting, furnace, chests
- [ ] Water and lava
- [ ] Fire
- [ ] TNT
- [ ] Mobs
- [ ] Grass spread
- [ ] Sand and gravel
- [ ] Boats
- [ ] Minecarts
- [ ] Plants
